about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am an experienced AI and software engineer with expertise in computer vision, time series analysis, and software development. Currently, I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Kyungpook National University, conducting research in AI-based medical imaging, time series analysis, and image generation. Additionally, I am proficient in developing models for limited data and enhancing generalization performance by mitigating data imbalance and overfitting problems. With 6 years of experience in AI research and Python, I possess skills in utilizing AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for model development and performance enhancement. Building upon these skills and experience, I have successfully completed numerous national and industrial projects.
